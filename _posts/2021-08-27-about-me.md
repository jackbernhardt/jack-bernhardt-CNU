####**About Me: Jack Bernhardt**

He/him

I am interested in the Digital Humanities as a way to utilize the translation of humanities and the digital and connect it with my career path of sales. Sales, like all fields, are moving towards a more digital platform and it is becoming essential to translate the important and relevent informsation into a digitally mediated format. This includes being able to, through computerized mediums, persuade, inform, and, in the end, sell a product as effectivley as you would in person.
