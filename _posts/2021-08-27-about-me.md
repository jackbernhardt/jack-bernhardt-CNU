I am a Communications major and senior at Christopher Newport. 

I grew up in Richmond, Virginia and graduated from Douglas Freeman High School. I also grew up as the  the oldest of **four** boys in my family.

I have one pet, a black lab named Calhoun who, in my free time, I love to throw frisbee with at the park. I also enjoy going to concerts and live music, playing sports like basketball and golf with friends, and watching whatever type of anime I can find. I have family in New York whose fandom rubbed off on me so I am a follower of the New York Giants, Knicks, and Yankees.

I believe that the Digital Humanities is a great course because it is **relevent** of the changing shift to digital mediums in our society. It can be applicable to a number of fields and will only benefit me in my career path. I also have always had an interest in the online medium as a way to promote and spread information. I use social media such as Twitter and Instagram for the production and ingestion of news and info for all types of topics, and understand its importance in our day and age.

I am interested in the Digital Humanities as a way to utilize the translation of humanities and the digital and connect it with my career path of sales. Sales, like all fields, are moving towards a more digital platform and it is becoming essential to translate the important and relevant information into a digitally mediated format. I am looking to fulfill a WI requirement but I also hope to develop into a better overall writer at the end of this course.
