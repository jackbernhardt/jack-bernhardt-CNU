I grew up in Richmond, Virginia as the oldest of **four** boys

I am interested in the Digital Humanities as a way to utilize the translation of humanities and the digital and connect it with my career path of sales. Sales, like all fields, are moving towards a more digital platform and it is becoming essential to translate the important and relevent information into a digitally mediated format.
