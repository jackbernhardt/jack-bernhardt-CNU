The Lord of the Rings Project looks to visualize many aspects of author J.R.R Tolkien’s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings book series. Tolkein wrote his books throughout the 1930’s to the mid 1950’s and made an importance in connecting the separate tales through massive world-building, including maps and fictional history of his fictional-universe, Middle Earth. The website includes a map of Middle Earth and uses it to display the timelines, places, paths and major events of the characters and books.

Though Tolkein’s stories were limited to the pages in his book, this project looks to illustrate Bilbo Baggins’ 172 day journey in The Hobbit and his nephew Frodo’s 6 month trek in The Lord of the Rings. This helps users and readers of the books to envision the locations and events in respect to each other, adding to the lore of Tolkein’s universe. The map includes a dropdown menu where you can select specific characters, places, and events and they are color coordinated for differentiation. The project, seperate from the maps, includes many other features as well. 

The ‘Middle-Earth in Numbers’ section in the main menu lists population statistics of the different races like Hobbits, Elves, Dwarves, and Men within the books. The statistics include race and gender ratios, life expectancy of races, ages distribution, and population on a multitude of graphs and charts. This section is another contribution to Tolkein’s extensive world-building and gives a great visual insight to the people within Middle Earth throughout its history. The project also includes a blog section along with the map and statistics in order to promote engagement surrounding the information and data.

I really like the initial layout and look of the website as you enter the homepage. All of the sections are listed at the top of the screen and are easy to navigate and understand. The homepage also lists updates in the blog or in new projects within any of the sections. The homepage includes an interactive genealogy chart of Middle-Earth to get users started. The map is also very simple in function and easy to understand. It initially shows Middle-Earth and has one path, Thorin and Company from The Hobbit, already highlighted. The map has a dropdown menu on the right side where visitors can choose to view timelines, places, paths, or events and the project makes this very simple and functional. From here you are able to click on other character paths like Frodo and Sam or Gandalf the Grey to compare or single out specific paths/journeys. I like how the website gives users the ability to click multiple paths at once or just one depending on how they want to view it. It gives the viewers the freedom of choice, you can compare the paths of different books, times, and people in a plethora of different forms.

All sections in the dropdown menu seem functional except for the timeline section. It seems as if the website intended so that when you click timelines a sidebar appears on the right side of the screen in order to give written descriptions of each event. When I used this section it didn't seem to work or have any connection with the map itself, which I found frustrating. The timeline sidebar was divided into sections (I am assuming for the descriptions of each event within that timeline) but only popped up with errors and warnings. While this section was underwhelming it was the only aberration in an otherwise well-functioning map. When I navigated to the statistics section it was another breath of fresh air. This part of the project takes population and gender statistics of Middle Earth and implements them into well operating interactive charts and graphs. This section is great and really helps to paint a picture on the people of Middle-Earth in an informative and interesting way.
