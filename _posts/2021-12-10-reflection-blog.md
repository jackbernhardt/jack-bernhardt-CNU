My idea around digital humanities has definitely changed and broadened since the beginning of the semester. I say broadened because I was not yet enlightened to the diversity involved, not only the countless traditions that digital humanities projects can cover, but how many ways a project can do that. Adding in the interactive element and there’s endless possibilities for people to interact with a humanitarian project than ever before through digital humanities

From connecting users to interact with redlining maps to CGI interactive online museums, digital humanities opens up connection to data in a way that no other study can. Knowing this now has helped me to understand the purpose of the field in a way I never imagined. It was also very helpful to learn this through the ways we interacted, proposed, and craft our own DH projects through the Grant and CNU projects.  

The readings were pretty helpful to help me understand how to cultivate many of my projects and blog posts this semester. I really liked some of the early readings like “Text Scanning Patterns: Eyetracking Evidence” helped me to create my posts in a style where I can space my paragraphs to have ‘scanners’ read the important information in my blog posts.

I also really enjoyed “Shitty First Drafts” which encouraged me to write down anything at first (even if its shitty) to begin to refine how I want the tone of my posts/papers to sound. These types of reading were very essential for me personally to become a better writer and communicator through technology and in general.

My favorite assignment this semester was the CNU Project, where we created our own DH project through the history of Christopher Newport. It was very engaging and helped me to develop skills in creating online projects that appeal to the eye but are also complex and have depth to them. 

Being able to take the research I developed of CNU’s history and connecting with the interactive map was very helpful as far as learning new skills, but it was also a very hands on and enjoyable project. This led me to become a better overall reader and also better at visualizing and projecting the information in which I read in a more aesthetic and coherent manner.

Another project I enjoyed very much were the Research Blogs where we were able to create our own blogs on the topic we learned about throughout this course. These posts helped me to find my inner-writer voice within the space of a blog, differing from normal scholarship where I would write more formally. 

I think the overall style of creating my blog posts in a style where a reader can spot important phrases and flow from paragraph to paragraph was a key aspect in making my writing more informal and personal. I really enjoyed the second research blog, it was fun to interact with a DH project that I related to. 

It was also interesting to see how intricate and complex some of the DH projects are in the world not only with their website design but also the information they can possess. 

Overall, this course was very informative and helpful towards me not only becoming a better writer, but in cultivating that writing in an online format. I interacted with technology in ways I didn’t think I could before, and this only added to my skills as a communicator and analyzer of information. Digital Humanities is a great medium in which anyone can excel their abilities in a number of different ways, through any topic they are passionate about. This was very reassuring to me after participating in the field and is very encouraging about the future of scholarship and the direction our world is moving.
