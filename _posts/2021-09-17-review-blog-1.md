Summary

Livingstone Online is a digital museum and weblog of the famous Victorian explorer of the 19th century, David Livingstone. Livingstone was integral in the exploration and colonization of Africa in the late 1800’s. His numerous 15,000 images and 780 transcriptions are some of the leading material in African history and help to paint a picture of the continent in these times. This includes paintings, travel logs, maps, and many more sources from Livingstone’s journey that hold high educational value for a diverse audience of people.

The website looks to mix modern and historical images to present a look into the Victorian age for a younger, more tech savvy audience. The website is an essential resource for the academic study of African history in the nineteenth century, and offers the most images and transcriptions of Livingstone and this era. The project is very diverse in topics ranging from spectral imaging of documents to a unique look at the behind the scenes of the project itself. 




Design

The project website is self-explanatory in use, divided into chronological sections about his journey in Africa. Each section has digital logs of his ventures and the website looks to translate these personal logs into a digital form. The website is divided into six main sections, “About this Site”, “In His Own Words”, “Spectral Imaging”, “Life and Times”, “Behind the Scenes”, and “Resources”. These are all color coded and consist of other subsections or ‘levels’ as users deviate into each topic.  

Livingstone Online consists of five sections, or as the site states, ‘levels’ within each main topic mentioned before. The first level is the home page, consisting of slideshows and images that reflect David Livingstone’s diverse disciplines and areas of study during his ventures.



The second level is centered around the section pages. These are pictures, organized into tiles, that show images from Livingstone’s journeys and life. Each image has links that direct you to other pages in the site explaining more detail about each picture or manuscript. 

The next section, or level, are the content pages that allow users access to critical essays on David Livinstone’s life. There are an array of different essays, written by all different authors about an assortment of different topics relating to Livingstone’s accounts in Africa. These essays also shed light into Livingstone organization projects, programs, and collaborations. 



Level four, the manuscript viewer, is one of the most essential sections within this website. This action within the project enables viewers to interact with high-resolution images of Livingstone’s original manuscripts. This is to mimic a real-life encounter with the explorer’s written document and assist users in full-interactivity that includes zooming, rotating, or sharing each of his over 7,000 individual manuscripts. Within this section of the website is where the most interaction is within the accounts and life of David Liviingstone and adding its mark to the digital humanities.

The final section are the browse and searching pages. This subsection is only within the section “In His Own Words” and gives a search and browsing section within the confines of the website. This is used to find a variety of items within the site's digital collections through addressee, repository, or timeline of a specific manuscript. The search section also allows visitors to browse Livingstone-related items, of which the project has over 3,000. The browse level helps a diverse audience find exactly what they are looking for from the project, looking to connect related materials with Livingstone’s collections and manuscripts.



Findings 

After navigating the website it became easier to understand, however at first it was a challenge. While the project has excellent organization among different topics, this is also the website’s detriment. Having subsections within subsections seems to make simple navigation more convoluted than necessary. Attempting to find something specific of Livingstone’s seems like walking through a maze and the website could have drawn measures to simplify their organization. 

The website uses a plethora of images, and could use more text-translations of the manuscripts and images. This would help to connect the images and written accounts with more context that would help readers connect understanding within Livingstone’s ventures.
